# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In the (still active) 0.X phase of the project only the latest stable minor release is getting bugfixes (including security ones).

So e.g. if the latest stable version is 0.42.3 and the latest beta version is 0.43.0-beta, then 0.42 line will still get security fixes but older versions (like 0.41.X) won't get any fixes.

Description above is a general rule and may be altered on case by case basis.
